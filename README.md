# InstagramBot
A Python Instagram CLI tool that traverses your Followers and Following lists, and shows you the list of people who aren't following you back, and people who you aren't following back (Sneaky, i know)

<strong>IMPORTANT: To run this script, you must have Selenium and Chrome Driver already installed.</strong>

All you have to do before running the script in your terminal, is to replace the username and password blank values with yours.
Also: In case you get any errors, check the XPATH causing the error, and replace it yourself with the one on the Instagram page
Steps:
<ul>
  <li>Right click on the element causing the error, and hit "Inspect Element"</li>
  <li>Right click on the exact class of the element in question ->Copy -> Copy full XPATH</li>
  <li>Replace the Path i typed with yours</li>
</ul>

This error is highly likely because Instagram often changes their front end.

Hope you like this small project! Cheers!
