# InstagramBot
A simple python Instagram bot that traverses your Followers and Following lists, and shows you the list of people who aren't following you back

<img src = "https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/87/87390.png" width="100" height="100">

All you have to do before running the script in your terminal, is to replace the username and password blank values with yours.

Also: In case you get any errors, check the XPATH causing the error, and replace it yourself with the one on the Instagram page
Steps:
<ul>
  <li>Right click on the element causing the error, and hit "Inspect Element"</li>
  <li>Right click on the exact class of the element in question ->Copy -> Copy full XPATH</li>
  <li>Replace the Path i typed with yours</li>
</ul>

This error is highly likely because Instagram often changes their front end.

Hope you like this small project! Cheers!
